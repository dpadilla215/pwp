<h1>Content strategy</h1>
   <div>
<p>Header: I plan to have a sticky header with the company name and logo as well as a dropdown menu.</p>
       <p>The drop down will be like the shadow scroll to each part on the page.</p>
   </div>
<div>
<p>I also plan to add an image that spans border to border under the header.</p>
    <p>There will be no space between the image and thew header.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>To break up the image from the content I plan to add a span piece of text between the two.</p>
    <p>The text will say Latest Releases</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>After the text I want to put each piece of merchandise.</p>
    <p>Each piece will have an image of the merchandise and text describe each item.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>After the merchandise im going to put an about section.</p>
    <p>The about section will have a brief section giving info on the company.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Then at the footer of the page I want to put a foot with contact information.</p>
</div>
