<h1>P.W.P Mile Stone 1</h1>
<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>I would like my pwp to help me accomplish showing off my friends T-shirts that he designed.</p>
<p>If the website gets enough exposure maybe he could start selling the shirts and making some money.(hypothetical)</p>
<p>If he starts to make sales on the shirts thanks to my website he can give me a percentage of his revenue.</p>
<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>The main audience for my website would be car guys looking to buy some cool graphic tees.</p>
<p>The main purpose of this website it to get the word out about the shirts and get them sold, for customers.</p>
<p>This website could also be classified as for use in the professional field because im going to have it on my git to be shown off to potential employers.</p>
<h2>Goal</h2>
<p>There are two main goals to this website 1. to show off to employers to potentially get me hired and 2. to get the word of the shirts out and potentially create sales.</p>
<p>The main goal is to show of to employers of course but if im able to help a buddy in the process and get a project out of it why not.</p>
